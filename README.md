1. Q/A System(PDF)
   
This project creates a Q&A system that extracts insights from a PDF document using advanced AI tools. The PDF is loaded and split into pages, and text embeddings are generated using OpenAI's embedding models. These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone index, enabling fast and efficient similarity-based searches. A GPT-powered RetrievalQA system processes queries with contextual understanding. The setup ensures precise answers while managing resources effectively with index cleanup post-usage.
